## [Code Challenge 1](ArrayReverse.java)


 - README for this challenge is complete
  - In this challenge I was tasked with reversing an array.
    - I got the lenghth of the array and then created a new array of the same lenghth to hold the reversed elements.
    - Loop through the array and use 'lenghth - i -1' to move the first index to the last and move each one down as well.
  -  We were not supposed to use a whiteboard link this time around since it's the first code challenge.
